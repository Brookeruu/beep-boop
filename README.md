By Brooke Perry

_This site was create as the Intro to Programming Week 3 Independent Project. The purpose of this project is to have a user input a number and receive a string of numbers, starting from 0, through the number input, with the following exceptions:

* If the number is divisible by 3, the output will be "Sorry, I cannot do that.".
* If the number contains 0, output will be "Beep!".
* If the number contains 1, output will be "Boop!"
* _Example for input 3, user receives, "Beep!","Boop!",2,"Sorry, I cannot do that!"_
